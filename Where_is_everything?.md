## Where can I download the application and plug-ins?

-   [QSApp.com](http://QSApp.com/)

As of ß61, plugins can again be installed from within Quicksilver and
update themselves automatically.

In ß59 and ß60, the built-in plugin refresh mechanism still looks at
blacktree.com. To get new plugins you must download them from the
[QSApp.com plugins repository](http://QSApp.com/plugins/index.php) and
install them manually (unzip and double click each one).
