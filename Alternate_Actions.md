Alternate actions are a very powerful feature of Quicksilver. When a
user selects an action in the second pane, they can hit ↩ to run it, or
they can hit ⌘↩ to run an alternate (if one is defined). Generally an
alternate action will be similar to the main action, but modified in
some way.

**Quicksilver ß71+**

As of Quicksilver ß71 you can view the alternate to a given action (if
it exists) buy holding the ⌘ key when Quicksilver's interface is open.
You can view a full list of the alternate actions in the 'Alternate
Action (⌘↩)' column of the \[qs://preferences#QSActionsPrefPane Actions
preference pane\].
