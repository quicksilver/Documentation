Module that displays QS objects as [QR Code 2D
barcodes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_Code). Support vCard for
contacts. Use something like [ZXing](http://code.google.com/p/zxing/) to
decode them.

Adds the actions:

-   Show QRCode which displays the object on screen (much like Large
    Type)
-   Copy QRCode (copies to the clipboard)
