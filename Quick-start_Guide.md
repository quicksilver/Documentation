## Installing Quicksilver

After you have downloaded Quicksilver, it will automatically decompress
into your downloads folder. Navigate to that location and drag
Quicksilver to your Applications folder (for best organization) or any
folder of your choosing as it can be launched from anywhere but the
Trash.

## Activating Quicksilver

First, launch the application by double clicking its name or icon.

Once it is running, there are several ways to activate Quicksilver:

-   Click on the Quicksilver icon located on the dock.
-   Type the global activation hot key (Control-Space by default).

## Searching for an item

Activate Quicksilver and then start typing some letters of an item (such
as an application, folder or filename). Quicksilver's matching algorithm
will try to choose the best option. The letters need not be consecutive,
but they should appear in that order in the item name. For example, if
you are searching for Preview, the letters prv, pre or prw would all
find the application. The letters you have typed will be underlined in
the name of the selected item to remind you what you entered.

If the selected item is not the one you wanted, the chances are that you
can find it in the results list. The results list pops up automatically
after a delay (which you can set in the
[Preferences](Preferences "wikilink")), or you can open it immediately
by using the down arrow key. Once in the list, you can navigate as
follows:

-   Up or Down Arrow Keys - Select a result.
-   Right Arrow or / - Show the contents of the item (for example, the
    contents of a folder).
-   Option-Right Arrow or Option-/ - show an alternative contents list
    (for example, invisible files or package contents).
-   Left Arrow or Shift-/ - Show item parent (go up the folder
    hierarchy).
-   Esc - Return to normal search mode. Escape again to dismiss the
    Quicksilver interface completely.

If you use the right arrow or slash to descend into the contents of an
item, you enter browsing mode. In this mode, any further searches you
make by typing letters will search only the item and sub-items in the
folder you have selected. For example if you select the Documents folder
in your home directory, the search will operate only on the files and
folders within Documents. If you want to go back to searching the global
catalogue, press Esc (or press Esc twice to dismiss the Quicksilver
interface completely). Reactivating the interface by typing the command
activation hot key will also reset the search.

## Performing an action on an item

The next step is to perform an action on the item you have selected.
Numerous actions are available, dependent upon the type of item
selected, but the default action for an application is Launch. The item
you have selected will be shown in the first field with the default
action (in this case Launch) in the second field. When you hit the
Return or Enter key, the default action is performed, and your
application is launched. If the application you selected is already
running, Launching will bring the application forwards. If you want to
use one of the non-default actions, select the second field by clicking
it with the mouse or hitting the Tab key, then use the up and down arrow
keys to select another action. Actions are discussed in detail in
[Commands](Commands "wikilink") and in the section on the Command Window
module.

The steps outlined above describe the basic use of Quicksilver as a
Launcher, but there's a lot more that you can do with it. If you want to
find out about more advance uses for Quicksilver, take a look at the
