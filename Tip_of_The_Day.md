===Tips===
\* Pressing delete while typing resets the search text without removing
the Object in pane 1. Press it again to clear pane 1.

-   Make a Trigger for 'Downloads\>Show Contents'. Instant results
    without putting the contents in the Catalog or waiting for a rescan.
-   Right-click on an Object in pane 1 to see its alphabetical list of
    its available Actions. Great for an overview. <http://t.co/YoQGDV4>
-   Paste a path like \~/Downloads directly into pane 1. Quicksilver
    will change it to a file. Or type it in; its icon'll show when QS
    finds a matching path.


\* Make a Trigger for 'Airport\>Show Contents' to get a list of
available networks. Instant access. <http://t.co/ldbeL70>
<http://t.co/w6tjqhE>

-   Hit ⌘⇧\[letter\] in Quicksilver to launch the default Action for
    ⇧\[letter\]. For example, ⌘⇧O executes 'Open' (if it's default for
    '⇧O').
-   Pipe files to Quicksilver from Terminal by installing the Command
    Line Tool plugin. Usage: 'qs file' or put on the Shelf using 'qs -s
    file'.
-   Reveal in Finder instead of Open: With a file in the 1st pane, ⇥, ⌘↵
    to use the 'alternate' Action. Check it out with other Actions!


\* Plugins labelled with a '(+)' need 'Enable advanced features' in
Quicksilver's Preferences\>Application pane to work.

-   Enable 'Capitalized keys modify action in command window' in
    Quicksilver's Preferences\>Extras to avoid having to tab to alter
    the Action.
-   Get any application's 'current document' in Quicksilver with the
    updated 'User Interface Access' plugin. <http://qsapp.com/plugins/>
-   Search iTunes tracks in one press: Install the iTunes Module, Go to
    'Preferences\>Triggers\>iTunes\>Search Tracks' and enable. Voila!


\* Instantly print Images and rtfs. Check
Preferences\>Catalog\>System\>Printers. Documents open their
application's print dialog. <http://t.co/CtFcnjt>

-   Alter Quicksilver's command window colours in
    Preferences\>Appearance. You can enable/disable glass/shadows and
    alter colours. <http://bit.ly/oWjwRO>
-   Open the Quicksilver interface with a single key by enabling the
    'Modifier-only Activation' setting in Preferences\>Command.
-   If you've installed the iTunes module for Quicksilver, check out the
    iTunes-specific triggers — awesome! E.g. 'Show Playing Track'.


\* Dismissed Quicksilver and want to search the last object's folder
again? Activate QS, press ← then → and it's ready to search.

-   Use Skype? Install the Quicksilver Services Menu Module then → into
    a contact in QS and use the Skype/Call or Skype/Send SMS Actions.

(Catalog)\>Show Contents' (QSPresetMainApplications). Fully searchable!

    set to 'Filter Results' A @ddjfreedom catch. <http://t.co/OUaqNCb>

    Keyboard System Preferences. From @neurolepsy <http://t.co/8EK6P1q>

it onto selected text to change its color. <http://t.co/iHayanG>

    'Wait before searching' time in the Preferences\>Command. Try 0.00s
