# Proxy\_Object

A proxy object is a Quicksilver object that is resolved dynamically, based on the current state of your computer. This is very useful if you want to create a trigger that applies to a current file/song/URL/the latest download/etc.

For example, a useful trigger might be "Current Application > Relaunch" ![Relaunch\_Current\_Application.png>](images/Relaunch\_Current\_Application.png)

Proxy objects can be added by plugins. For example, the [Safari plugin](https://docs.qsapp.com/documentation/safari\_module)'s "Current Web Page" proxy object will refer to the current page you have open

You can view your available proxy objects under Quicksilver's preferences > Catalog > Quicksilver. ![Proxy\_Objects\_in\_Catalog.png>](images/20130325014416!Proxy\_Objects\_in\_Catalog.png)
