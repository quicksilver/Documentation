# Plugin\_Reference

Plugins contain additional or application-specific functionality that can be added to Quicksilver. Install plugins in the "Plug-ins" pane of [Preferences](https://docs.qsapp.com/documentation/preferences).

**The compatibility charts are often best guesses - if you have better information, set up a wiki account and/or email devs@qsapp.com, or tweet @LoveQuicksilver.**

Videos: If you use Flash, play the video, select 720p HD (if available), and then press full screen. (It makes the videos far easier to read.) **Note:** some of these are for very old versions of quicksilver and might be out of date.

Use at your own risk.</p><p>Prerequisites iTerm Usage To use iTerm as the Handler/Helper for the command line interface:</p><p>Bring up the Quicksilver Preferences window. Choose the 'Handlers' pane. Choose 'iTerm' for 'Command Line Interface'. Now the following actions should use iTerm:</p><p>Go To Directory in Terminal Run a Text Command in Terminal Run in Terminal [...] The plug-in also provides iTerm-specific version of the above commands:</p><p>Go To Directory in iTerm Run a Text Command in iTerm Run in iTerm [...] Show Man Page [1] These commands may be used regardless of the Handler/Helper command line interface setting.</p><p>[1] 'Show Man Page' does not appear to be handled by the mediator.</p><p>Known Issues and Notes Escaping of arguments may be iffy. If iTerm is running but there are no windows, iTerm actions may not work. Execution of a command in the first tab in iTerm is not supported yet. The iTerm version of 'Show Man Page' behaves a little differently than the corresponding Terminal action -- exiting the man command does not end the shell session.

If that's not what you want, move them down the list in your Quicksilver preferences.</p><p>The plug-in tries to be smart about which actions to display. For instance, you won't see "Disconnect from VPN" unless that connection is currently active.</p><p>NOTE: If Viscosity isn't running, any of the "Connect…" actions will start it. This is generally what you want, but be aware that if you've configured certain VPNs to connect on launch, they will be connected regardless of what you are trying to do via Quicksilver.</p>                                                        |                                                                                                       |
