# Comma\_Trick

The 'Comma Trick' allows a multiple selection in the first pane of Quicksilver (QS).

A comma is the character between the following quotes: ','

To select items from within the same folder:

Invoke QS, navigate to within a folder, press comma, and navigate to/search for another item in that folder.

To select items from different folders:

Invoke QS, navigate to within a folder, press comma, press escape, and search for another folder.

Or:

Invoke QS, navigate to within a folder, press comma, and press left or right to navigate to another folder.

To select items from anywhere in the QS Catalog:

Invoke QS, search for a cataloged item, press comma, and search for another cataloged item.

Pressing delete will remove the last comma-selected item from the selection. (In the above picture, TextEdit.)
