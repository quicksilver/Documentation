This script allows you to open AirDrop using Quicksilver.

Save this script somewhere that Quicksilver can find it, such as
\~/Library/Scripts, then bring it up in the first pane and use the Run
action.

If you want to get fancy, you can apply the AirDrop icon to the script
file. To do so: (1) right click on AirDrop in the Finder sidebar and
select Get Info from the contextual menu, (2) similarly open the Info
window of your Open AirDrop.scpt file, then (3) click on the AirDrop
icon in the first Info window, press Cmd-C to copy it, and finally (4)
click on the generic script icon in the other Info window and press
Cmd-V to paste the new icon.
