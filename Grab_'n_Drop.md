Another way to use Open With… is to select the file (or files) in
Finder, then activate Quicksilver and select the application to use in
the first pane. Then instead of tabbing to the Action pane, just type
⌥⌘G. The command window will change so that the file is in the first
pane, the Action is Open With… and the application is in the third pane.
It’s a little convoluted but it is quick.

The ⌥⌘G trick also works with the Move to… Action. In Finder select the
file or files to move, activate Quicksilver and bring up the destination
folder in the first pane. Then instead of tabbing to the Action pane,
just type ⌥⌘G. The command window will change so that the files are in
the first pane, the action is Move to… and the destination folder is the
argument. Type enter to execute the Command. Mouse users might prefer to
just drag the file from Finder to the folder when it's in the first
pane.

Puts the current selection from Finder/Path Finder as the selection in
QS, with the selected item as the target for an Action. E.g., if
Application X is selected in QS and File Y is selected in Finder,
hitting Cmd-opt-G will display File Y\>Open With\>Application X; if
Directory Z is selected in QS and File Y in Finder, hitting cmd-opt-G
will display File Y\>Move To\>Directory Z.
