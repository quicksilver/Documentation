### Display the Clipboard on Quicksilver launch

If you want the Clipboard History window to display when Quicksilver is
launched, type this in terminal

`defaults write com.blacktree.Quicksilver QSPasteboardHistoryIsVisible -boolean YES`

Otherwise, change the `YES` to `NO` to hide the Clipboard History when
Quicksilver launches
