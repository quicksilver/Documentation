In 2006 and 2007 Howard Melman wrote a comprehensive manual for
Quicksilver. The last version was for Quicksilver version B54. Since
then Quicksilver has been updated considerably and updates to the manual
are under way. Much of the manual is still useful for explaining what
Quicksilver does and how to use it. Some of the configuration details
have changed quite a bit, so don't be too frustrated if explicit
directions don't work exactly.

The latest version of the **User's Guide** is
[here](http://qsapp.com/docs/Quicksilver.pdf).

Things to keep in mind:

-   Ignore any reference to "enabling advanced features". This setting
    was removed in Quicksilver 1.0.

Also there is a short Quicksilver Quick Reference which has been updated
for the Quicksilver 1.0. It lists all actions in all supported plugins
as well as proxy objects and most shortcuts.
