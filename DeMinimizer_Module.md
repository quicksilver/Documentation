This Module allows you to minimise and deminimize windows from within
Quicksilver. It also provides some useful proxy objects and triggers.

Setup Ensure 'Enable access for assistive devices' is enabled in the
Universal Access preference pane Customize the provided triggers
appropriately Usage Try the bundled triggers -- three of them are for
restoring minimized windows and one of them should minimize all windows.

There is also a 'Minimized Windows' proxy object which can be used to
observe a list of minimized windows. The proxy object and individual
minimized windows which it resolves to may also be used with the
'Restore Minimized Window' action.
