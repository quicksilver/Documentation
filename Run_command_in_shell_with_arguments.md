The following AppleScript code should be saved as a standard AppleScript
.scpt file in \~/Library/Application Support/Quicksilver/Actions.

# Usage

Enter a text command in Quicksilver's first pane and then either enter a
string of text in its third pane or select one or more files in the
third pane.

By default, the POSIX paths of the files selected in the third pane (or
the string of text entered in it) will be appended to the end of the
command entered in the first pane.

Optionally, the command entered in the first pane can specify where
arguments from the third pane should be substituted in. There are two
methods to do so:

1\. Use $@ to indicate where all the arguments should go in one glob.
Example:

`       somecommand -i $@ --switches`
`       `
`   will place all third pane arguments between -i and --switches`
`       `

2\. Use $1, $2, etc., to place specific arguments at specific points in
the command. If an argument number is called for, but there are not
enough arguments supplied in the third pane, this action will abort with
an error message. If more arguments are supplied than there are argument
numbers called for, the remaining arguments will be appended to the end
of the command. It is possible to skip numbers in this sequence (e.g.
$1, $3).
