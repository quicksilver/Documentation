# 1Password\_Module

### Description

The 1Password for Quicksilver plugin enables you to right arrow into the 1Password application, giving you a list of all your data saved in 1Password. It also gives you the ability to catalogue all your 1Password data and manipulate it from within Quicksilver.

### Actions

#### Go & Fill

This action will perform just like the Go & Fill action from within 1Password on your saved Web Forms. The 'Go & Fill...' action works with the comma trick, so you can open multiple logins at once.

#### Reveal In 1Password

### Catalogue Entries

The plugin can index and catalog all your 1Password data; web forms, accounts, software, identities, wallet items and notes.
